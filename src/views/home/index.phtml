<h1>Welcome on Webubbub!</h1>

<p>
    Webubbub is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/">Websub</a> hub.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Important: the hub is actually opened and doesn't require to register.
    Itâ€™ll probably change in the future so don't use it in production.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    If you have a blog, you can configure your <abbr>RSS</abbr> or Atom feed by
    adding this link element:
</p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;link href="<?= url_full('Requests#handle') ?>" rel="hub" /&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Aggregators that support Websub will soon discover the link and subscribe
    to this hub.
</p>

<p>
    Next time you'll publish an article, just send a POST request to the hub with the following parameters:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>hub.mode="publish"</code></li>
    <li><code>hub.url=&lt;URL of your feed&gt;</code> (that's important the
    URL is exactly the same than the <code>self</code> link in your feed)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For instance, with curl:
</p>

<pre>
<code>curl -d "hub.mode=publish&amp;hub.topic=&lt;URL of your feed&gt;" -X POST <?= url_full('Requests#handle') ?></code>
</pre>

<p>
    It should work well but Webubbub is still young so please be comprehensive
    if you encounter bugs. It also lacks of documentation so please come back
    later for more fun!
